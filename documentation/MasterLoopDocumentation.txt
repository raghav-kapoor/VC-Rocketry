FLIGHTMODES
	0: Just turned it on.
	1: Passed preflight check #1
	2: Passed preflight check #2
	3: In ascent
	4: Reached apogee, in descent
	5: In descent, waiting to deploy squibs
	6: Landed, waiting for pickup
	
TRIGGERS
	Preflight check #1: LiPo disconnected from external power (we pulled out the switch)
	Preflight check #2: 9V battery connected
	Determining ascent: z-acceleration greater than 3.5 g
	Determining apogee: based on altitude from pressure
		none of the measurements are <= zero (sensor is still intact)
		the last 10 measurements are within 5 meters
	Determining deployment: apogee detection starts a timer
	Determining landed:  last 40 measurements are within 1 meter.

OTHER DETAILS
	Data is sampled 25 times/second, and sent down at that rate.
		Could be adapted to sample more frequently (50 times/second) and only send every other frame down
		Data is written out to a file with the timestamp of the start time of the program.
	Emergency deployment:  whenever the rocket passes a particular altitude for cutoff (set before hand),
		a flag is enabled, and emergency deployment is now permitted
		If the altitude is ever below that cutoff again, the squibs have not yet been deployed,
		and apogee has not yet been detected, then the rocket must have missed apogee detection
		and the emergency deployment system activates
		This takes care of the issue if the pHat sensor fails mid-flight
	Initial parameters:
		Set in a separate file.  Each time the program runs, it reads the file.
		parameters are updated one at a time in the program when necessary (safety)
	Errors:
		All errors are named and written to files, where possible.
		If data fails to transmit, that will be written to the file.
		If a sensor fails, zeroes or negative numbers are written in place of the real data.
		The only fatal errors occur when a sensor is being initialized and it is not found (pHat specifically)
